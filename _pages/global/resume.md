# The Agents You Can Call On

The Time Machine Agency takes pride in each Agent of our team for their hard technical skills, paired with warmth, humor, and clarity in communication. All agents have a keen eye for creative design tailored to their client's goals, and each agent operates as an equal partner of the Agency. For this reason we select few and expect an exacting standard of ingenuity and leadership.

Our Agency only represents the best available talent for our clients. For hourly rates we bill at market rate, higher end, and project-based billing may offer discounts for clients who come with an audaciously-scoped project proposal, and/or clients with whom we have a developed working relationship. Discounted rates are also offered to all local nonprofits and educational institutions with qualifying project proposals.

Our evaluations are entirely free and offer up to three hours of meeting with the best agent for your goal. We maintain strong relationships with other professionals in the field and our community--if we believe that we know another team that can better serve your particular ambition, we strongly advocate for you to go with the best solution you can.

Send an email to <a href="mailto:Dream@TimeMachine.Agency?Subject=Hello%20There" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dream@TimeMachine.Agency</a> to start the conversation today.
